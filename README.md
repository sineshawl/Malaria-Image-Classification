# Malaria Image Classifier

This repository contains a deep learning model for detecting malaria in blood smear images using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Overview

- **Architecture**: The model is built on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a powerful deep learning technique for image classification tasks.
- **Dataset**: The training dataset consists of approximately 27,000 images, evenly divided between infected and non-infected blood smear samples. This diverse dataset allows for robust model training and evaluation.
